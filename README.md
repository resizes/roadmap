# Dash Roadmap

Welcome to the public roadmap for Dash, the all-in-one platform built to simplify deployments and elevate the developer experience.

This repository provides visibility into what's in progress, what's planned, and what's being considered for the future. It serves as a space for discussion, feedback, and community input to shape Dash’s development priorities.

## What is Dash?

Dash is a developer-first platform designed to accelerate the software delivery lifecycle. It combines deployment workflows, configuration management, and environment visibility into a single, cohesive experience — built to remove friction, not add complexity.

## Purpose of This Repository

This roadmap is intended to:
- Share the current priorities and feature pipeline.
- Gather feedback from users and the community.
- Promote transparency around product direction.
- Allow developers and stakeholders to suggest features or improvements.

## Roadmap Structure

The roadmap is managed using GitHub Projects and is divided into four key columns:
- Noted: Ideas, features, and tasks that are planned but not yet started.
- Research: Gathering insights, analyzing requirements, and evaluating potential solutions.
- In progress: Features or tasks currently being developed by the team.
- Done: Features or tasks that have been completed, tested, and deployed. Available in the product.

Suggestions and feedback are encouraged. To propose a feature or improvement:
- Open a [new issue](https://github.com/resizes/roadmap/issues/new) using the feature request template.
- Clearly describe the need, use case, and expected outcome.
- Engage in discussion with the community and maintainers.

## Discussions and Feedback

For open conversations and broader ideas, use the Discussions tab. It's the right place to:
- Share use cases
